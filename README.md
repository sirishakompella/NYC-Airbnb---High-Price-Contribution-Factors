# NYC-Airbnb---High-Price-Contribution-Factors
R for Linear Regression Decision Trees and XG Boost
Used NYC Airbnb dataset from Kaggle. 

Used Linear Regression to predict the rental price of accomodations in NYC listed in Airbnb.

-We have cleaned and visualized the data.

-Understand which variables are important to contribute to price prediction (finding correlations between variables).

-Created Linear Regression model to predict price, calculated RMSE and MAPE to understand accuracy of prediction.

-Plotted the prediction values' accuracy comparing with original dataset values.

-Implemented a stepwise regression on the model to check if it optimizes the prediction.

Built a regression tree model to check if it gives a better prediction than linear model.

Built XGBoost model to check which among the 3 models gives a better prediction.

Conclusion: XG Boost gave us highest accuracy with 94% and has been the fastest model among the three.
